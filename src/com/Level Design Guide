Level Design Guide
------------------------------------------
	-Each pixel represents one tile
	-the color and alpha of a pixel determine what will be spawned there
		Pink: Player Spawn 0xffff00ff
		White: Air 0xff000000
		Black: Collision 0xff000000
		Green: Turret 0xff00ff00
		Red: Health Ball 0xffff0000
			-Alpha 255 (0xffff0000) Gives 100 Health, Alpha 155 (0x9bff0000) Gives 0 Health
			-Anything below 155 will subtract health
		Blue: Mana Ball 0xff0000ff
			-Alpha 255 (0xffff0000) Gives 100 mana, Alpha 155 (0x9bff0000) Gives 0 mana
			-Anything below 155 will subtract mana
		Yellow: Lava 0xffffff00
		Other: Air 
		
	-Turrets will automatically attach to the nearest surface
		-if there are multiple surfaces, the turret will prioritize below, right, left, then above
	-Anything out of the map by default has normal collision, but outlining the level in black is still a good idea
